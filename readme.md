# resharper-template-descriptions

When ReSharper displays its code completion window, it frequently provides a tooltip to provide more information about the item you're about to select. Live Templates don't display the description, leaving only a potentially cryptic shortcut in the code completion list.

This plugin adds that tooltip back.
